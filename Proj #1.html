    <i>125 Points</i>   
</div>
<h3>Due Date/Time:</h3>
    <p>
    Your project is due at 4:00 P.M San Diego time on Thursday, February 26th.  As 
    this is a large project, you should start on it right away.  It will take longer 
    to complete than you might first think.
    </p>
    <p>
    The entry point for your project is a file called <tt>index.html</tt>.  
    Make a new folder in your <tt>public_html/</tt> folder called "<tt>proj1</tt>" and 
    place the <tt>index.html</tt> in it.  Thus, the first page of your 
    project (the login screen) will be displayed if the user directs the 
    browser to: <tt> http://jadran.sdsu.edu/~jadrnXXX/proj1</tt>
    </p>
    <h3>Perl/CGI/Javascript/SQL Review Assignment:</h3>
    <p>
    This assignment is designed to review and reinforce fundamental principles 
    of dynamic programming.  The tools you may use for this project are:  
    Perl <i>(mod_perl only)</i>, xhtml/html 5, CSS 3, Javascript, and the MySQL database on opatija.  
    You may use a Javascript library 
    such as JQuery if you wish. For this project, you must use Perl for all 
    scripts.
    </p>
    <p>  You will create 
    an <b>online store selling some type of merchandise</b>. The type of products you 
    choose to sell is entirely up to you.  Some suggestions:  
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>cameras</li>
        <li>shoes</li>
        <li>clothing</li>
        <li>jewelry</li>
        <li>DVDs</li>
        <li>software</li>
        <li>food products</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p><p>
    Give some thought to your choice;  you will be creating 
    additional projects (#2 and #3) using this online retail model.  
    You should design an 
    attractive and appealing theme or Look and Feel for your project.
    Please review the Project Design Guidelines (link at left).
    </p>
    <p>
    For this first assignment you will create a portion of an inventory 
    application for your online retail site.  This portion is an application 
    to allow a buyer to create inventory records for new products that the 
    retailer will sell.  The application consists of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>A login screen</b>. &nbsp;&nbsp;The user must supply an 
        authorized 
        username/password pair to gain access to the system.</li>
        <li><b>Menu page</b>. &nbsp;&nbsp;Once login succeeds, 
        the user will
        be presented with a page that gives choices to:
        <ul>
            <li>New Inventory Record, <i>add a new record</i></li>
            <li>Edit Inventory Record <i>change some or all of an existing record</i></li>
            <li>Delete Inventory Record <i>remove a record from the system</i></li>
            <li>Log out of the system</li>
        </ul>
       Rather than a blank page with four links, load the New Inventory Record page 
       as the default, with links clearly available for the other choices
       (tabs are a good choice here).</li>
        <li><b>Confirmation</b>. &nbsp;&nbsp;After any of the above actions, 
        you must display a confirmation, recapping the information 
        just submitted, along with a message that the submission was successful 
        (or not as the case may be).  This may be a new page, or you may use AJAX
        to display the information in the existing page.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Details:</h3> 
    <p>
    <b>The Login Screen</b><br>
    Present the user with two fields, the <i>username</i> and <i>password</i>. The form 
    should also have a <i>clear</i> and a <i>submit</i> button.  If the user enters a valid
    username/password, the Menu page will load.  If the login is invalid, then 
    the login screen should reappear, along with a helpful error message.
    </p>
    <p>Username/password pairs should be stored in a text file on the server (<b>not</b> in the MySQL
    database).  The 
    username should be stored in plain text, and the password should be stored in an 
    encrypted form.  You may <b>not</b> hardcode any username/password pairs in your Perl code.
    You must have at least five valid username/password pairs, one of which <b>must</b> 
    be:
    </p>
    <pre>    username:   cs645
    password:   sp2015
    </pre>
    <p>
    You must use POST as the parameter passing method.  Use Javascript to place the 
    cursor on the username field when the page loads.  Simple things can mean a lot for 
    useability.  The user should not have to grab the mouse and manually give focus 
    to the username field.
    </p>
    <p>
    You must save state.  Access to the add/edit/delete portion of the system 
    can only be allowed for authorized users.  Note that it is not sufficient to display
    the add/edit/delete page on successful login.  You must validate the user on submission 
    of data.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>The New Inventory Item screen</b><br>
    This is the form for adding a new item to the online store's inventory.  New items 
    must be stored in the MySQL database on opatija.sdsu.edu.  For this project you will 
    create tables with the following fields, all of which are <b>required</b>, not optional.  
    <i>This means that the user must provide this information when entering an 
    inventory record</i>:    
    </p>
<ul>
    <li><b>SKU</b> The stock number.  This is a seven digit string, 
    with three capital 
    letters, followed by a dash, followed by a three digit number.  Examples:  ARC-001,
    ZZF-992 etc.  This will be the primary key in the inventory table, and as such it 
    must be distinct (no duplicates).  <i>Retailers
    generally use a proprietary code to identify each item they sell.  The code is meaningful 
    only to the retailer.  Example:  item number at Costco</i></li>
    <li><b>Category</b>  Almost all types of products need a category.  For example, camera 
    categories might be:  DSLR, Point and Shoot, Underwater/weather-proof, film etc.
    <i>Some types of products may need subcategories.  Add this if you need to.  Example: Shoes, 
    dress, casual, walking, athletic, and these categories may be valid for men, women, or 
    children</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Vendor</b>    The name of manufacturer or brand of the item.</li>
    <li><b>Manufacturer's Identifier</b> Mandatory field.  This is either a name or item 
    number used by the manufacturer to identify the product.</li>
    <li><b>Description</b>   One paragraph that describes the new item.  
    It should be suitable for displaying on the consumer page that will come later.  
    i.e. it should be geared 
    toward customers.</li>
    <li><b>Product Features</b>    A list-oriented specification of the
    features or properties of the inventory item.</li>
    <li><b>Cost</b>   Currency format, this is the price the retailer pays
    the manufacturer for the product.  Note, the $ symbol should not be used with the cost.</li>
    <li><b>Retail</b>  Currency format, the retail price that customers 
    will pay for the product. <i>[ You 
    will need to add inventory items for project submission.  Please select reasonable 
    values for the cost and retail prices.  Set the retail price about 25% above cost. ]</i></li>
    <li><b>Product Image</b>   An image of the new inventory item which may 
    be uploaded.  Store the filename along with the rest of the fields in the form in the 
    MySQL database, but store the actual image file in a folder on the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Here is an example record:

<p>
You must use Javascript to validate the form.  As much as possible, your Javascript
should help the user enter correct information.  Think carefully about how you implement 
the validation.  Be sure to use Javascript to put focus on the first field when the 
page loads.
</p>
<p>
A note about your project database tables.  Good design will require a minimum of three 
tables in your database:  SKU, category, and vendor.  You do <b>not</b> need 
to make any provision for creating/editing/deleting records from the category 
and vendor tables.  This is an appropriate simplification.  Any needed changes 
may be made by interacting with the database directly.  This is not as uncommon 
as it may sound--buyers often need to submit requests to the system administrator 
for such actions.
</p>
<b>Edit Inventory Page</b>
<p>
This screen allows the buying office to change any field in the form except for the SKU.
You should allow
the buyer to search for a record to modify, using the SKU field only.  Populate the form 
with the existing data, which the buyer may change and save.  Once an edit has
been completed, the record must validate correctly.  If the user needs to change an SKU,
the record must be deleted and re-added.
</p>
<b>Delete Inventory Page</b>
<p>
This screen allows the buyer to delete an inventory record from the system.  You should 
allow the buyer to search for the record to delete by SKU only.  Note:  Delete should be 
allowed only in cases where a given SKU has had no activity. That is, to delete items that 
have never been stocked or sold.  However, since we are creating 
this application first, you need not make any provision for this.
</p>

<b>Confirmation Page</b>
<p>
Every action (add/edit/delete/logout) should result in a confirmation that displays 
the status of the action.  If an error occurs, display a helpful
error message.  In any case, if you send a confirmation page, 
include at the top of the page a link to take the user
back to the login screen or menu page as is appropriate.  Note:  you must insure that only
authorized users have access to the system.
</p>




    <h3>Project Submission</h3>
    For this project, you will submit two things:
    <ol>
        <li>Deploy your application to jadran.  If you build your application on your home 
        computer, you must insure that it is properly deployed on jadran.</li>
        <li>Create an empty file in your <tt>public_html/proj1/</tt> folder named 
        <tt>'finished'</tt>.  If this file does not exist in your project folder, it 
        will not be graded.  Please see the Project Submission Guidelines (link at left).</li>
    </ol>

        <h3>Grading:</h3>
        <p>
        Your grade will be determined based on four criteria: inclusion of 
        the minimum specifications, validity and quality of your code, the creative and 
        professional appearance of your project, and also the usability.
        </p>

        <h3>Cheating:</h3> 
        <p>
        Just a reminder here.  Collaboration  is not permitted for this 
        course. You are expected to complete all project assignments 
        <b>on your own</b>. 
        You must write all xhtml/html, css, Javascript and Perl code on your own.
        You may use JQuery or any other Javascript library if you wish.
        You may <b>not</b> use any code generation 
        tools (Dreamweaver, Frontpage etc). Collaboration with anyone , or 
        use of 
        code generation tools is considered cheating.  If you adapt or copy 
        code from the Internet, be sure to cite the source.  This should be 
        limited to specific techniques.  Any student 
        caught cheating on the projects or a midterm exam will receive an "F" in the 
        course, and a report will be filed with the University.
